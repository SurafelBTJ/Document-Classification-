# Document-Classification-

This repo conprises the python script to classifiy unstructured data (documents). The data is converted into numerical vectors using tf-idf and four types of supervised machine learning algirhtms were applied, namely, Linear Support Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Naive Bayes. The code was also done to perform oversampling as the classes were not balanced and it was done as a prior to fitting the models.
